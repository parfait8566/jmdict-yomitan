# JMdict for Yomitan

![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/parfait8566/jmdict-yomitan?style=for-the-badge&label=Last%20Release)

This repository contains automatically generated dictionaries for use with [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan)/[Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/), a free Japanese dictionary browser extension. They are built using information from the [JMdict](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project) project, which is a freely available Japanese dictionary maintained by the [Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group](http://www.edrdg.org/). There are also releases for [JMnedict](https://www.edrdg.org/enamdict/enamdict_doc.html) and [KANJIDIC](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project), which are respectively a Japanese proper names dictionary and a kanji dictionary.

This repository is automatically updated daily and the dictionary files are built from JMdict using the [Yomitan Import](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan-import) tool.

## FAQ

### Legacy vs Extra/Regular JMdict

The legacy JMdict for Yomitan is a version of JMdict for Yomichan with legacy formatting and with lots of information missing. The so-called "extra" version of JMdict was [introduced by stephenmk](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import/pull/40) to modernize the formatting and add vital missing information such as notes, type information, source languages, references, antonyms, other forms, and more.

The terminology of "Extra" is confusing since it implies that the extra version is a marginal improvement to the legacy version, so we will just call it the "regular" JMdict. The legacy version is available for download as some third-party apps do not yet support new structured-content features, but we recommend using the regular version if possible as you will be missing out on a lot of important information otherwise.

### How Often Should I Update?

- The **JMdict** project [is quite active](https://www.edrdg.org/jmwsgi/updates.py?svc=jmdict&i=1) so we recommend you update your JMdict files every few months as lots of entries are added and improved upon every single day by contributers. You can even [contribute yourself here](https://www.edrdg.org/jmwsgi/edhelpq.py?svc=jmdict&sid=).

- The **JMnedict** project is [also somewhat active](https://www.edrdg.org/jmwsgi/updates.py?svc=jmdict&i=1) although arguably less relevant. However, there is an old version of JMnedict from before it was [updated by stephenmk](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import/pull/41); the old version is structured in such a way that you get a lot of search bloat when searching any kanji or kana so we strongly recommend you download the newest JMnedict at least once.

- The **KANJIDIC** project [does not appear to be as active](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project), so it is probably fine not to update it.
